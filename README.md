# üåç Global Grassland Datasets: A Comprehensive Overview

This repository provides an overview of various global-scale grassland datasets, including datasets that classify and map grasslands as part of broader land use and land cover (LULC) datasets.

## üìä Dataset Table

| Dataset Name | Description | Temporal Coverage | Spatial Resolution | Data Format | Data Type | Source |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------------|-------------|-----------|--------|

| **World Grassland Types** | Provides a global biogeographical characterization of large-scale grassland ecosystems, combining the International Vegetation Classification and Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World. | Not specified | Not specified | Vector (Polygon) | Categorical | [Earth Observer](https://www.earth.observer/datasets/world-grassland-types/) |

## üìå Notes:
- These datasets offer valuable insights into global grassland distribution and characteristics.
- Many of these datasets can be accessed via Earth observation platforms such as Google Earth Engine, NASA LP DAAC, and ESA‚Äôs Copernicus service.
- Depending on your research needs, you may select the dataset that best fits your requirements.
- If you know of additional datasets, contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit a pull request.
